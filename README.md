# Assignment 1 Information retrieval
The is a project made for the course Information Retrieval.
It is made in dart because I love the language. It is part of a bigger project that can be found at https://github.com/Triple1312/scida/tree/main
## How do you know it works?
In the Scida project I wrote tests for it. This is how I know everything works. Feel free to run them yourself ;)
